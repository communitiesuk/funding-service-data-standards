# MHCLG Funding Data Standards

Data standards create a consistent way to collect, manage, and use data.  

When data is in a consistent format, it can easily be used and compared across the organisation. It makes it easier for: 

- data collection teams when they are deciding what data to collect and how, as they can follow an established format
- data providers as they only need to submit data in one format, and not multiple times in different ways

## Data standards for funding data

We are currently developing data standards to be used when we collect funding data. 


Since August 2024, the data standards team have been working on:

- defining a set of data standards for risk, organisation and finance
- investigating existing standards and indentifying any gaps in meeting our user needs
- defining a reusable template for presenting and consuming data standards
- exploring technical elements and challenges of implementing data standards
- creating recommendations for implementation, governance and change control
- a further set of recommendations for future data standards

So far, we have published:

- [Grant](/grant.html)
- [Risk](/risk.html)
- [Organisation](/organisation.html)
- [Reporting round](/reporting_round.html)
- [Person](/person.html)
- [Certification](/certification.html)
- [Finance- expenditure](https://communitiesuk.github.io/funding-service-data-standards/finance.html#expenditure-data-standards)
- [Finance- allocation](https://communitiesuk.github.io/funding-service-data-standards/finance.html#allocation-data-standards)
- [Outputs taxonomy](/output_framework.html)  
- [Outcomes taxonomy](/outcome_framework.html)
- [Address](/address.html)

The standards we will publish next are in our [roadmap](/roadmap.html).
