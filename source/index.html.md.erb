# MHCLG Funding Data Standards

The data standards project was set up following the 'data quality and consistency' design sprint. 

During the sprint, it was clear that more in-depth work was needed in this area so a new multidisciplinary data standards team was created.

Since August 2024, the data standards team have been working on:

- defining a set of data standards for risk, organisation and finance
- investigating existing standards and indentifying any gaps in meeting our user needs
- defining a reusable template for presenting and consuming data standards
- exploring technical elements and challenges of implementing data standards
- creating recommendations for implementation, governance and change control
- a further set of recommendations for future data standards
