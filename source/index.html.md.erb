# MHCLG Funding Data Standards

The data standards project was set up following the data quality and consistency design sprint.  

The team involved in the sprint found that more in-depth work needed to be done on data standards. This work included:

- defining a set of data standards for risk, organisation and finance
- investigating existing standards and indentifying any gaps in meeting our user needs
- defining a reusable template for presenting and consuming data standards
- exploring technical elements and challenges of implementing data standards
- creating recommendations for implementation, governance and change control
- a further set of recommendations for future data standards
