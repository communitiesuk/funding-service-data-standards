# Outputs taxonomy
### version: 1.0

In government funding, outputs are the tangible deliverables or results produced during a project, representing specific tasks or activities. They focus on the "how" of achieving goals, while outcomes focus on the "what" you want to achieve.

The purpose of the standard for Outputs (taxonomy) is to ensure that grant teams collecting data via the Funding Service are collecting a standard set of data, to enable analysis and comparison.
