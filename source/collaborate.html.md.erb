# Collaborate and help us improve

<%= warning_text('TODO - this is taken from the Planning pages and should be rewritten but I feel the sentiment is what we want to convey.') %>

The data design process is a collaborative and open process. We want all interested parties to be involved in the design of the data they need, produce and use.

There are different ways to contribute depending on what stage in the process a planning consideration is at. Find out how you can contribute.

We will set up working groups for various planning considerations. They will be open to everyone that’s interested in working on the subject.


## Tell us about a data standard

First, check if the data standard is on our radar. Look at our [roadmap](/roadmap.html) and see if it is there.

If it is, you will be able to see where it is in our process.

We have lots of data standards on our backlog, if you think a consideration should be a higher priority for us then get in touch explaining why you think it would be valuable for this data to be made available on planning.data.gov.uk

If it isn’t, tell us what we are missing.

If you do not see the data standard on the backlog get in touch. You can let us know what we’re missing on [GitHub](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-data-standards/issues) by starting a new issue. The more you can tell us about the consideration the better. Tell us about why you think it would be good to work on, why the data is important and how it will be used.


### Tell us about the data

During the assessment and review stages, we are trying to determine how the needs for the data standard. We need to:

- Understand what data needs to be collected.
- Understand any business policy requirements for the data in question.
- What is the data going to be used for.
- What is the purpose of collecting the data.
- What decisions or processes does the data enable.

You can share the information with us on the relevant [GitHub](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-data-standards/issues) discussion for the data standard.

If you can't find the discussion you need you can create a new one.


### Tell us how you use the data

We need to understand how data and data standards are used at the moment.

What processes do you follow to create an instance of the data? What is involved in the process, and what is produced by the process?

And, then how do you use the data, when do you use it and why?


### Tell us how the data could be used

Good data helps someone do something. Whether that is completing all the requirements for their application or making a decision about the application.

To make sure any data has this desired impact, we need to understand what the data should unlock.

We need to know where and how the data could and should be used. We need to know what questions could be answered with the right data available.


## Help us create a practical data model

During the adapt and extend stagestages, we are looking to develop a data model that we are confident will work.


### Drafting the data model

When we develop data models we follow the principles, rules and patterns set out in the data design manual (*nb. we don't have this yet but the [planning one is here](https://standards.planning-data.dev/)*).

You are welcome to use the manual and submit proposals for planning considerations you are interested in. The best place to share these is on the relevant [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-data-standards/issues).

When a data model has been drafted, it should be opened up for comments. Interested parties should review it, ask questions and comment on whether you think it meets your expectations.


### Define the categories
Some fields in a dataset are constrained. For example, there are only so many valid application types. Quite often, these are used to classify or categorise a record.

We need your help to define the fields in a data standard. Domain experts and people working on local plans best know the vital stages. Tell us.

This is an ongoing process; tell us if and when they change.

### Test the data model

Any data model needs to be tested. It needs to be tested to check that it meets the identified needs and that it is feasible for data providers and implementers to create and publish it.

Provide any sample data you have.

We’ll also share any data we get or create.

You’ll be able to try out that data and tell us:

- what’s useful about the data.
- what is missing, for example, what you could do if only you had ..?



## Help improve our process

To help improve our process, you can:

- take part in the discussions on [GitHub](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-data-standards/issues), ask questions and share your thoughts.
