# Defining the standards

One of the outputs of the the data standards project was to create a blueprint or process for defining data standards. The intention is to use this blueprint to define future data standards across MHCLG.

- Evaluate and measure
- Iterate

## Assess data needs

Before defining a data standard, it is important to understand the needs.  It is therefore important to: 
- understand what data needs to be collected
- understand any business policy requirements for the data in question
- what is the data going to be used for
- what is the purpose of collecting the data
- what decisions or processes does the data enable

## Review Existing Standards

Once we understand the needs and the drivers for defining the data standard, we need to review existing related standards used within MHCLG, Government, and the wider funding ecosystem. We do this by:

- Undertaking desktop research to collate existing standards for the given data subject, including:
  - Standards used within MHCLG
  - Reviewing Open Standards for Government - [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk)
  - Consulting [ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com) for any in-train standards work or standards used in other Government departments
  - Reviewing more generalist standards such as [schema.org](https://schema.org) and [DCMI: Dublin Core™](https://www.dublincore.org)
  - Reviewing any standards used by Local Authorities such as [LG Inform Plus](https://esd.org.uk)
- Documenting data standards and their data points
- Collating standards and comparing differences

## Adopt and Adapt to Suit Needs

At this point, we should have an understanding of our data needs and a picture of any existing standards and their data points.

To ensure consistency, we should, where possible, use an existing standard as this reduces diversity and the need to customize. If this is not possible, a suitable data standard should be used as the starting point, with additional data points added and/or removed as necessary. Creating a data standard from scratch should be a last resort.

The data standard should then be documented using our Data Standards Template (for unpublished standards) to ensure that we capture all relevant information, including:

- Data point name and description
- Data types and formats of data
- Validation of data details
- Whether the data is mandatory, optional, or conditional
- Source of data point and rationale for inclusion

## Assure

Once a draft version of a data standard has been documented, it is essential to get feedback to ensure that the data standard meets the needs of its users and the business processes it supports. Assuring data standards should involve:

- Business stakeholders relating to the subject matter
- Subject matter experts within MHCLG
- Data specialists within MHCLG
- Delivery teams involved in the development of any digital products affected by the data standard
- System maintenance teams responsible for the upkeep and support of any business systems potentially affected by the data standard

## Implement

Implementation of a data standard may be complex, and the time required will vary depending on the system changes involved and the processes they support. Implementation changes should be planned and involve all interested parties.

### Considerations for Implementation:

- Interoperability and integration with other systems
- Changes to user interfaces and support business processes for collecting the data
- Additional validation and conditionality
- Reporting and management information changes
- Any audit or capture of longitudinal changes
- Deadlines and important policy dates

## Evaluate and Measure

Once a system or process has become data standard compliant, it is important to monitor those changes over a period of time to ensure they meet the needs of its users.

### Key Considerations:

- Are the users needs being met?
- What is the user experience in any implementation changes?
- What issues are there in collecting the data?
- Is there any data missing, or some data that is no longer needed?
- Are business processes more efficient, or have issues been introduced?
- Do users understand why the data is being collected?
- Are there changes to data quality?
- Are reports accurate and do they contain the right information?

These observations should be communicated with the data standard owner and the data community in general.

## Iterate

It is important to note that data standards will change—whether as a result of a period of monitoring and evaluation, a change in policy, or a shift in user needs. Where changes are needed, it is important to capture why and go through the cycle of defining the data standard from scratch.

This will enable validation that the data standard remains relevant and continues to meet the needs of its users. By assuring the change and following the governance process, we ensure that the data standard is changing for the right reason and that any impacted systems are aware of the change and the effort required to implement it.
