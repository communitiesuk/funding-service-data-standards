# Defining the standards

One of the outputs of the the data standards project was to create a blueprint or process for defining data standards. The intention is to use this blueprint to define future data standards across MHCLG.

- Iterate

## Assess data needs
Before defining a data standard, it is important to understand the needs. Therefore, we need to assess:

- what data needs to be collected
- business policy requirements for the data
- what is the data going to be used for
- what is the purpose of collecting the data
- what decisions or processes does the data enable

## Review existing standards

Once we understand the needs and the drivers for defining the data standard, we need to review existing related standards used within MHCLG, government, and the wider funding ecosystem. 

We do this through desktop research, reviewing and documenting:

- standards used within MHCLG
- [open standards for government - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-standards-for-government-data-and-technology])
- [ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com](http://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/) looking at any standards work in progress or standards used in other government departments
- more generalist standards such as [schema.org](http://schema.org/) and [DCMI: Dublin Coreâ„¢](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/)
- any standards used by Local Authorities such as [LG Inform Plus](https://home.esd.org.uk/)
- documented data standards and their data points
- any differences in data standards

## Adapt and extend to suit needs

At this point, we should have an understanding of our data needs and a picture of any existing standards and their data points.  

To ensure consistency we should, where possible, use an existing standard as this reduces diversity and the need to customise. If this is not possible, a suitable data standard should be used as the starting point and then additional data points added and/or removed as necessary. If should be a point of last resort to make up a data standard from the beginning.

The data standard should then be documented using our data standards template to make sure that we capture all relevant information, including:

- data point name and description
- data types and formats of data
- validation of data details
- whether the data is mandatory, optional or conditional
- source of data point and rationale for inclusion

## Assure
Once a draft version of a data standard has been documented, it is essential to get feedback to assure that the data standard will meet the needs of its user and the business processes that it supports. Assuring data standards should involve:

- business stakeholders relating to the subject matter
- subject matter experts within MHCLG
- data specialists within MHCLG
- delivery teams involved in the development of any digital products affected by the data standard
- system maintenance teams responsible for the upkeep and support of any business systems potentially affected by the data standard

## Publish
Once the data standard has been defined and assured, it needs to go through a final governance process before being published.

## Implement
Implementation of a data standard may be complex. The time it will take varies depending upon the system changes involved and the processes that they support.  Implementation changes should be planned and involve all interested parties.  

Considerations for implementation:

- Interoperability and integration with other systems
- Changes to user interfaces and support business processes for collecting the data
- Additional validation and conditionality
- Reporting and management information changes
- Any audit or capture of longitudinal changes
- Deadlines and important policy dates

>It is important to note that data standards are the minimum data set that should be collected. Each system may want to collect additional data, especially if its needed to support system function or a user's journey. 

## Evaluate and measure
Once a system or process has become data standard compliant, it is important to monitor those changes over a period of time to make sure they meet the needs of its users.  

We need to ask:

- are the users' needs being met?
- how is the user experience affected following any implementation changes?
- what issues are there in collecting the data?
- is there any data that is missing or no longer needed?
- are business processes more efficient or have issues been introduced?
- do users understand why the data is being collected?
- are there changes to data quality?
- are reports accurate and contain the right information?

These observations should be communicated with the data standard owner and the data community in general.

## Iterate
As we gain more information and research, data standards will develop. This could be following a period of monitoring and evaluation, a change in policy or a change or user needs. Where changes are needed, it is important to capture why the changes have been made and go through the cycle of defining the data standard from the beginning.

This will help you to validate that the data standard is still relevant and is continuing to meet the needs of it users. By assuring the change and following the governance process, you will make sure that the data standard is changing for the right reason. Also, it means that any impacted systems are aware of the change and the amount of effort it takes to change it.
