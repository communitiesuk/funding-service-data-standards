# Certification  
###version: 1.0
Certification is the process of signing off data and confirming that it has been reviewed and is accurate.  
It is done by the person responsible for managing the finances of the organisation. In local authorities, this is usually done by a section 151 officer (Section 95 officer in Scotland). In charities or businesses, this is usually done by the chief finance officer.
