# Outcomes taxonomy
### version: 1.0

Outcomes are short- to medium-term changes caused by outputs.  They help to measure how effective a programme or service is and make sure it provides value for money.  

The outcomes taxonomy standard makes sure grant teams collect a standard set of data to analyse and compare.  

There should be both actual outcomes and forecast outcomes.
