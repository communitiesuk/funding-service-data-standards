# Outcomes Taxonomy
### version: 1.0

In government funding, outcomes are the short- to medium-term changes that are achieved. They are a way to measure the effectiveness of a program or service and to determine value for money. They are determined as the external consequences (results) of changes in service outputs.

The purpose of the standard for Outcomes (taxonomy) is to ensure that grant teams collecting data via the Funding Service are collecting a standard set of data, to enable analysis and comparison.
