# Risk
### v0.2

This data standard represents how risks are recorded with MHCLG. This aligns to the MHCLG’s [Risk Management Framework](https://mhclg.sharepoint.com/sites/RiskKnowledgeCentre/SitePages/Risk-Management-Framework.aspx) which sets out the Departments approach to managing risk in order to:

- protect our people
- protect our reputation
- protect against financial loss
- minimise disruption to the programmes which achieve our objectives

## Risk standards

These are the standards in risk:  

**Risk ID**  
This is a unique identifier of a risk. It is automatically generated.  

**Organisation ID**  
This is a unique identifier of the organisation that owns and has reported the risk. It is automatically generated.  

**Risk title**  
A short description of the risk in fewer than 100 characters.   

**Risk description**  
A description of the risk that includes:  

- what could go wrong?  
- what could happen to cause things to go wrong?  
- what would the outcome be if it did go wrong?  

Where possible, the risk description should be formatted like this:  
There is a risk that x happens, due to y, which will result in z.  
This field should be fewer than 5,000 characters.  

**Principle risk category**  
This is the category of risk. It must be one of the following options:  

- Arms length bodies  
- Commercial  
- Financial  
- Governance  
- Information and data  
- Legal  
- Local Government delivery  
- People  
- Project delivery  
- Resilience  
- Security  
- Strategy  
- Systems and infrastructure  

**Risk status**  
This is the overall status of the risk. It must be one of the following:  

- New/Identified  
- Assessed  
- Controlled  
- Escalated  
- Watch  
- Closed  

**Risk owner**  
This should be a person who is responsible for the overall management and reporting of a risk. Owners of risks are generally: Principal Risk Level: Director General, Portfolio Level: Director, Tier 1 Level: Deputy Director, Tier 2 and Project Level: Grade 6/7.

**Risk to life**  
Ask if there is risk to life, and record yes or no. 

**Current impact score**  
This should show the impact of the risk. It must be one of these options:  

- 1 - Very low  
- 2 - Low  
- 3 - Medium  
- 4 - High  
- 5 - Very high  

**Current likelihood score**  
How likely a risk is to happen. It must be one of these options:  

- 1 - Very low  
- 2 - Low  
- 3 - Medium  
- 4 - High  
- 5 - Very high  

**Current total risk score**  
This is a calculated value that shows how severe the risk is. It is created by multiplying current impact score by current likelihood score. It must be a whole number.

**Current mitigations**  
These are any current mitigations already in place for the risk, and can include an overall risk mitigating strategy. It must be plain text and fewer than 2000 characters.

**Planned mitigations**  
Any planned mitigations that will be in place. They can be assigned to others if required. There should be a title, details of the action, priority, due date, owner, and frequency of updates needed. It must be less than 2000 characters.

**Target impact score**  
This what the risk impact will be after the planned mitigations have taken place. It must be one of the following options:  

- 1 – Very low  
- 2 – Low  
- 3 – Medium  
- 4 – High  
- 5 – Very high  

**Target likelihood score**  
How likely a risk is to happen after the mitigation has taken place. It must be one of the following options:  

- 1 – Very low  
- 2 – Low  
- 3 – Medium  
- 4 – High  
- 5 – Very high  

**Target total risk score**  
This is a calculated value that shows how severe the risk will be after mitigations. It is created by multiplying target impact score by target likelihood score. It must be a whole number.

**Proximity**  
This is the length of time that the impact of this risk covers. It must be one of the following:  

- < 3 months  
- 3 to 12 months  
- 12 to 24 months  
- 24 to 36 months  
- > 36 months  


**Risk approach**  
This only applies if the target score is lower than the current score. There are two options: treat or tolerate.  
Treat: Mitigations will be planned and implemented to reduce the current score so it is the same as the target score.  
Tolerate: The risk owner decides that further mitigations are not needed or possible.   

**Path to target?**  
This is the question: “are the planned mitigations sufficient to bring the risk within target?” with a yes or no answer.

**Date to target**  
This is the date by which risk is expected to be within target. This is often the date that the last mitigations are implemented. It is formatted as a date: YYYY-MM-DD.

**Risk closed date**  
This is the date and time the risk is closed.   
It is formatted as date and time: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.  

**Risk closed by**  
This is the person who closed the risk, and the format is a person’s name. 


## Data entities

The risk data standard consists of the following entities:

- **Risk** - the main articulation of the risk, its priority, likelihood and impact
- **Organisation** - the reporting or owning organisation of the risk
- **Person** - details of the owner of the risk and mitigation actions

## Implementation guidance
| Data field | Guidance |
|------------|----------|
| Fields marked `"readOnly": true` | These fields are marked `readOnly` to indicate that they should be determined by application or database logic rather than user input. |
| Organisation | The JSON schema suggests that there should be a direct link between `Risk` and `Organisation` but this isn't necessarily the case, as long as the data model allows a `Risk` to be traced back to the `Organisation` which owns it. |
