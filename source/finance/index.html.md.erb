# Finance

The finance data standard has been split into 3 sub categories - allocation, payments and expenditure. This is due to the size and complexity of the standard, and the number of teams and people involved.

### [Finance - expenditure](/finance/finance_expenditure/index.html)
The expenditure data points are the data points related to monitoring and evaluation.

### [Finance - allocation](/finance/finance_allocation/index.html)
The allocation data standard is the data points required **before** a grant is awarded.
