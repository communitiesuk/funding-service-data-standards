# Organisation
### version: 1

This data standard describes the information MHCLG collects about organisations, in order to provide funding. Our aim is to:

- have one source of truth of information about people and organisations
- maintain consistency across the funding lifecycle
- maintain consistency in terminology used to describe organisations

## Data entities

The organisation data standard consists of the following entities:

- **Organisation** - the main data entity detailing Organisation information
- **Person** - the main contact for the organisation
- **Address** - the primary contact address

![Organisation Entity Relationship Diagram](/images/organisation-ERD.png)
> An Organisation entity relationship diagram showing the relationships between the Organisation, Address and Person entities, where Organisations should have one primary Address and one primary contact Person. In reality, a Person would also likely be linked to one or more Organisations in order to properly manage User permissions.

## Reference Data
As shown in the schema above, where appropriate, organisations should include one of the following reference data fields when their organisation type matches the corresponding value.

| Reference data field | Source |
|---------------|---------------|
| Organisation Name | [Companies House FAQs](https://ewf.companieshouse.gov.uk/help/en/stdwf/webIncHelp.html#:~:text=The%20company%20name%20cannot%20contain,not%20permitted%20in%20the%20name), [Incorporation and names - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incorporation-and-names/incorporation-and-names) |
| Companies House reference number | [Companies House Registration Number Formats](https://www.hmrc.gov.uk/gds/com/attachments/coy_reg_no_formats.doc) |
| Charity Commission number | [Charity Commission Number](https://foodstandardsagency.github.io/enterprise-data-models/patterns/charity_commission_number.html) |
| Local Authority code | [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/namescodesandlookups), [Local Authority Dataset - Planning](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/local-authority), [Local Authority Names](https://github.com/mysociety/uk_local_authority_names_and_codes/blob/main/data/uk_local_authorities.csv) |

There are a number of potential sources for Local Authority code (direct from ONS, via the MHCLG Planning dataset (though this only covers LAs in England), and Delta (which is based on the ONS data but updated manually ahead of the regular ONS publishing dates.

The consensus is that Funding Service will use the LA codes from Delta as the source of truth for Local Authority codes.
