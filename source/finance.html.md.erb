# Finance Allocation
### version: 1.0

Finance data standard has been split into 3 sub categories - Allocation,  Payments and Expenditure, this is due to the size of the standard, the complexity of it and the number of teams and people involved. The purpose of the Allocation data standard is that these are the data points required BEFORE a grant is awarded. Multiple teams have been involved in the collation of these data points - Commercial Central Grants Hub and Assurance teams, finance business partners and grant policy teams.
