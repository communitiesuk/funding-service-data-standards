# API reference

Use an API reference page to list your API endpoints, methods, requests, responses and errors. You should auto-generate your API reference rather than writing it by hand, so it’s easier to keep your API reference in sync with your API code.

Follow the guidance on [writing API reference documentation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/writing-api-reference-documentation).

You can [convert an OpenAPI file](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/write_docs/add_openapi_spec/#convert-an-openapi-specification-into-documentation) into an API reference page in your documentation.

Just for reference, here's an example codeblock:
