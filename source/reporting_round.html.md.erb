# Reporting round 
### version: 1.0

A reporting round is a round of performance monitoring and evaluation data that grant recipients need to submit. This helps to make sure we achieve value for money and keeps the grant recipient accountable for the outcomes they need to deliver.

When the grant is being designed, the policy team will decide how often they want recipients to submit data. The data is then reviewed and compared to check that delivery meets expectations.
